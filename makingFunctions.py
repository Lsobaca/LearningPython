# what is a function?
# a function is a sequence of statements
# that does computation. we can call on them
# later or reuse them many more times. sometimes
# they can have arguments or not take in anything

# some functions are already built in such as the math
# module
import math
# would print "w" since w has the highest value
max("hello word")

# type casting is a built in function that would convert 
# the value to the disired value
# this would return '32' 

int('32')+1
